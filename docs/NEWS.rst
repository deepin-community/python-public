@public change log
==================

4.1 (2024-03-29)
================
* Add support for Python 3.12. (GL#22)
* Switch to ``hatch``, replacing ``pdm`` and ``tox``. (GL#21)

4.0 (2023-06-05)
================
* Drop Python 3.7 support. (GL#16)
* Remove ``public.install()`` which was used to inject the ``public`` and
  ``private`` functions into the ``builtins`` namespace.  This isn't very
  helpful and could be actively harmful.  Explicit is better than
  implicit. (GL#14)
* The functional form of ``public()`` now returns the argument *values* in the
  order they are given.  This allows you to explicitly bind those values to
  names in the global namespace.  While this is redundant, it does solve some
  linter problems.  (GL#12)
* Switch from ``flake8`` and ``isort`` to ``ruff`` for code quality. (GL#32)
* Bump dependencies.

3.1.2 (2023-05-31)
==================
* Switch to ``pdm-backend`` (GL#15)
* Bump dependencies.
* More GitLab CI integration improvements.

  and ``setup.cfg``.
* Build the docs with Python 3.8.

================
* Do type hinting the right way. (GL#10)

2.2 (2021-04-13)
================
* ``public()`` and ``private()`` can't be correctly type annotated, so the
  type hints on these two functions have been removed.  The ``ModuleAware``
